if you manage to rise before dawn, the hostel we styed at offers sunrise yoga at 6:30 every morning. the class takes place down by the pier, where the world still feels half-asleep. you begin moving while the sky is dark and the moon keeps watch, but by the time you open your eyes at the end, the first light spills over the horizon. its soft, golden and perfectly timed. breakfast isn’t served until eight, which leaves a nice pocket of time: 45 slow minutes for a morning swim in the cool water or a bit of sketching while the day wakes up around you.
