“What’s your favourite Pendulum song?” I asked as I approached two girls I’d been eyeing from across the venue. We were still in the pre-show lull as people were slowly filling up O2 Academy. There were blue spotlights lighting up the sides of the venue, which were decorated with white stone pillars. There was a faint smell of beer mist in the air and the volume was still low enough that one could make conversation. It was the perfect time to adopt strangers.

They turned towards us at the same time and somehow they were even cooler up close. Both wore dark outfits with elegant, gothy touches: necklaces with crosses, miniskirts, pink eyeshadow and several silver rings. *It looks like they had fun getting ready*, I thought to myself. The one on the left had balayage hair that melted from brown into pink at the ends and the other wore shorter brown hair and had beautiful green eyes.

“Tempest,” Green Eyes said immediately, like she’d been waiting for someone to ask her that exact question.

“Watercolour,” Pink Hair replied after a moment of consideration.

I lit up. “Strong answers. Very strong answers.”

Behind me, Andrea nodded in approval, "It's funny because everyone we've asked has given us a completely different answer" he said "Seems there is no standard favourite."

We’d been doing this for the last half hour – wandering around the standing area and interviewing people the way academics collect sample sizes. Except instead of data, we were harvesting vibes.

“How about you two?” Green eyes asked.

“The Island - Part I” I answered, thinking about the many hours I had spent with that song on repeat while clearing out my apartment and packing down my life over the past weeks.

"Mine is Archangel," Andrea added and I remembered the jamming session we had had over at his place before leaving. I had spent one of my couch surfing nights there and we played our favourites on his guitar and electric bass.

Pink Hair sipped her drink thoughtfully, then leaned in. "You two aren’t from here, are you?”

I wasn't sure if it was the bluntness in my approach or Andrea's Italian pronunciation of the word *archangel* that made her guess this. “No,” I admitted with an awkward laugh. “We actually just got to London yesterday. It’s my first time in the UK, even.”

Her eyebrows shot up. “Wait — you came just for this concert?”

“Yep,” I said, popping the p like a proud idiot.

“That’s so sick,” the other girl said. “I love that.”

There was a pause, but it was not an awkward one, just that small window where everyone mentally confirms *okay, yes, we’re hanging out now*. So we shifted into the little social dance of exchanging details and asking questions. Names first. Pink Hair was Sofia. Green eyes — Ellen.

“So what made you pick Pendulum for your first UK trip?”

“Well, they played in Stockholm just a few weeks ago, but we missed it due to my indecisiveness" I admitted with an awkward laugh. "When we had finally decided to go, the tickets were sold out."

"But then I got a text message from her just saying: *crazy idea*," Andrea filled in.

"Yeah, so I looked up if we could go somewhere else to see them and it turned out that they were playing the same night I was going to London anyway," I clarified "We figured there wouldn't be a concert here in London tonight if it wasn't meant to be."

"And I wasn't hard to convince," Andrea added.

Ellen smiled and tucked a strand of hair behind her ear. “Actually genius.”

We talked a bit about where they were from (I didn't know the places), the concerts they’d been to (I didn't recognise the names) and then Sofia casually mentioned: “Yeah, this is, like… my seventy-somethingth gig this year.”

I choked on absolutely nothing. “Seventy?”

“Seventy plus,” Ellen corrected.

“That’s—” Andrea looked at me. “Basically twice a week all year. Jesus!”

Sofia shrugged modestly. “It’s just my thing. Some people do gym. I do mosh pits.”

We adored her instantly.

“And what do you two do?” Sofia asked.

We each gave our mini-bios. I kept it short; tech/math girl, recently quit my job at a bank, currently unemployed slash adventurer. Sofia turned out to be a fellow tech girl currently at Goldman Sachs and Ellen a fellow un-employee. 

“Well — between jobs.” she said, and we fist-bumped over our mutual lack of structure. I felt myself relaxing around them in a way that was immediate and rare. Something about their presence made both me and Andrea feel calm. Then the pre-band started playing and the four of us herded toward the bar together. The queue was long enough to encourage conversations that go past surface-level.

I looked at Sofia. “If you were an animal, what would you be?”

“A dog.” She didn’t even blink. "But, you know, only if I was treated well, like my dog is."

That reminded me so much of Tilda, my chest tightened. Tilda was one of my best friends back in Stockholm. She used to ask that exact question all the time — throwing it out like confetti, and she'd always have a good answer herself as well. She’s imaginative like that. Gentle but curious. I saw a bit of her in Sofia’s spark and for a few moments I felt that small ache of homesickness, but the good kind — the kind that means you care about people deeply enough to miss them.

Then the lights dimmed for the first time. A collective shiver passed through the crowd.

“Oh shit,” Andrea said, eyes widening with excitement. “It’s starting.”

The guitar riff to *Napalm* rolled out, vibrating through the floor, through my ribs, through the whole crowd. Red strobes cut through the smoke. And the first line:

“*Drop bombs, we’re ’bout to go napalm*”

made the crowd erupt – swallowing the four of us into a mosh pit that moved like a single living creature.

<div class="centered-italic-text">* * *</div>

“What do you mean I can’t check in?” I asked, in half-panic, hollowed out and confused at Heathrow airport. Andrea hovered to my left where I was standing at the American Airlines check-in desk, talking to an agent.

The woman at the desk gave me an apologetic look. “You’re transiting through Dallas, right?”

“Yes?”

“Then you need ESTA authorization to enter the U.S., even if you’re only passing through.”

“I — what? But I filled that in.” I replied in a tone that wasn’t defensive so much as disoriented. “I did the health declarations, the disease prevention thing, the UK one… I...” It struck me all of a sudden that in all the travel preparations I had indeed missed this application. 

She nodded kindly. “This one catches Europeans all the time. It’s very common. Don’t worry, dear — you can just apply for it now. Once it’s approved, you can check in.”

Her gentleness hit me harder than the information itself. I nodded like a malfunctioning robot and stepped aside with Andrea.

We had had a very stupid idea of not sleeping that night. "Oh, if we just stay up after the concert we can spend a full night doing street photography in London before heading to the airport in the early morning!" I had said to Andrea two days prior. 

"What a great idea! And then you'll sleep soundly across the Atlantic" he had replied. 

*Tuf, you are such an idiot*, I caught myself thinking as we found two seats under a too-bright light that felt like judgement. I opened my phone with trembling fingers and started the ESTA application.

It wasn’t difficult. I remembered doing something similar for the UK recently. That one had come through instantly. *This will be the same*, I told myself. *Easy.* Then I read the small text at the bottom of the page: “Processing may take up to 72 hours.” and my stomach dropped.

I walked back to the counter clutching my passport like a stress toy. “What happens if it… doesn’t go through?” I asked the woman quietly.

“Oh, sweetheart.” She offered me a reassuring smile. “If that happens, I’ll just rebook you onto the next flight. Free of charge.” Relief flickered at those three words.

“When is the next flight to Dallas?”

“Oh, those run often. The issue is your connection. Dallas to Cancún flies more rarely. If you miss today’s flight, you’ll also miss your Cancún connection. The next one is…" she clicked around her screen "tomorrow. Same time.”

*A full 24 hour delay. Yikes, Tuf. Now you've outdone yourself.*

We stepped aside again, and that was when the fatigue struck me like a blunt object. The combination of:
- zero sleep,
- adrenaline crash,
- airport lights,
- having to say goodbye to Andrea,
- and the sudden possibility of not seeing Louise that day

It all stacked up into something too unbearable. I sank into the seat next to Andrea, pressed my forehead against his shoulder, and cried. He wrapped an arm around me without saying anything. And he didn’t need to. Just being a warm place to collapse into was enough.

I kept reloading the application page in hopes that I would magically be accepted instantly. It didn't change.

"You know, whether the application goes through now or in 10 minutes doesn't matter. I think we should just leave it for a few minutes and rest your brain." Andrea spoke in a calm tone. "It's gonna be okay. Do you want a coffee?" 

I knew he was right and closed my phone, but the thoughts kept rolling through my head . *If I have to stay overnight in Dallas where do I go? I can always sleep on the airport floor, even if it's horrible. Or I can stay an extra night in London and catch the same route tomorrow.* And so on it kept spinning. *No matter what I do, I have to find a place to sleep within the next few hours even if it's right here on the floor.* "I think I'm good without coffee, thank you" I finally replied.

When I had calmed down a little, I opened the phone again. No news from the ESTA application so I navigated to the messages

That was accurate. The right shoulder of Andrea's green hoodie was soaked in my tears. *Ew, get yourself together*. I had been crying in that sort of exhausted way where you don't even sob, you just leak. And I had leaked quite a significant amount. 

"I need to leave for Terminal 2 soon if I'm going to make the flight back to Stockholm," Andrea said softly "but I checked and if you have to stay another night I can stay too. There is a reasonably priced flight tomorrow as well."

"There is no way I'll let you do that"

"iiiiPhone moneyyyy", he teased.

I couldn't help but smile at that. The fact that winning a small lottery could change our perspectives of how to spend money so quickly was both entertaining and kind of interesting from a psychological point of view. I wondered if it's for the best that I never have access to much money.

I continued objecting "But it's not just that – you have a game tomorrow!" 

Andrea’s club had two teams in Division 1: the A team, built to aim for elite level, and the B team, where Andrea played along with our beach volleyball friend Lukas, the captain. Despite the labels, the B team had been outperforming A all season, so their face-off was expected to be a bit of a showdown. I knew how much he wanted to be there for it.

"I know and I want to play, of course. But I don't want to leave you here like this."

"It's okay. I will manage this somehow. My tears are just for dramatic effect, but I'll make it on my own" I assured him.

"Are you sure?" 

"100%"

He stood up and gathered his things. I stood up with him, preparing for a long hug. 

"Oh, I can't believe that I don't know when I'll see you again" he said as we embraced each other.

"You're gonna have a beautiful winter" I replied with confidence, thinking about how I had tasked my mother with making the snow come early this year, which is usually my job. *Someone has to do it*. "And it's up to you to decide when you use that iPhone money to come visit us in Argentina or wherever we are."

"If only you knew where you're gonna be"

"I'll let you know as soon as we do." I assured him as we let go of each other "Now, I can't have both of us miss our flights today! Off you go!" I tried to shoosh him away towards the escalators leading to terminal 2.

"I will miss you."

"And I will miss you. Now go crush the A team."

This was the last thing I said to him before he set off. I gave him a weak smile as he descended out of sight. The moment he was gone I instantly collapsed in the seat and began sobbing. An elderly man two seats to my left looked at me funny, but I did not care. I was struck by the feeling of loneliness so suddenly and with so much force that I couldn't keep it in. *We all have to feel like this at some points in our lives.* I thought to myself in a reassuring manner. *It will be okay, let's check the ESTA application one more time and if it has been approved you're good to go. If it hasn't, you can roll your dice to see what's going to happen.*

I reloaded the application page and was not surprised to see no changes whatsoever. Application still pending. So I took out my trusty d6. *Should I go get a coffee?* I asked myself as I rolled, knowing that rolling a prime number means no and a non-prime number means yes. I rolled 6. *Oh wow, I guess I will be fine*. An instant feeling of relief hit, seeing my favourite number displayed in dots on the side facing up. I picked up the dice from the floor where I had rolled it and put it in my pocket while scanning for nearby cafés. I saw a sign stating that there are restaurants on the floor above, next to security, and set off towards the lifts. 

I had a small packet of instant coffee in my bag and thought I could just ask the café for some hot water to mix it in. That would save me an expensive airport drink that I couldn't actually afford and I just felt that I needed the heat from drinking something warm – even if I normally see instant coffee as a form of oral abuse. *I need to adjust my taste buds to poverty anyways.*

As I approached the café I tried to wipe my tears away and look... normal. "Good morning," I greeted the woman at the cashier "would it be okay if I just got some hot water?"

The woman at the counter replied instantly "Why, of course!" Then she looked me up and down and asked "you all right, love?" 

There is something about the Brits calling you *love* that makes you feel seen. I knew it was just something they throw around left and right and that this woman had absolutely zero love for me – we didn't even know each other – but there is just a tenderness to that word.

"Well, no" I started, my tears filling up my eyes again "or I mean, I am truly okay. I am going to Mexico – there is literally no need to feel sorry for me!" I gave a sad little laugh while wiping my tears away.

"Oh, well being away from family is always hard" she replied with a warm smile, clearly relieved that nothing bad had happened to me "Here, have one of these as well. Might just cheer you up" She handed me a cookie along with my cup of hot water. 

The cookie was almost as large as my hand and looked like a melting snowman. He — *Melvin*, according to the little striped box — lay dramatically sprawled across a gingerbread biscuit, his body pooling outward like he’d given up on resisting the laws of thermodynamics. A marshmallow served as his head and he had two thin chocolate arms stretched outward in a theatrical “help me” gesture. He seemed just as helpless as I felt.

“Thank you,” I managed, accepting both the cup and the cookie with a sniffly smile while tearing up even more at the sweet gesture.

I stepped out of the café and found a seat overlooking the concourse. The airport hum felt calmer from here. I set Melvin on my knee like a tragic little companion, tore open my cursed instant coffee packet, and poured it into the hot water. The smell rose up instantly. *Ah, the unmistakable scent of desperation.*

I stirred it with the packet itself and took a sip. *Yup. Oral abuse*. Still, the warmth spreading through my chest felt nice. For a moment, I just sat there, staring at the cookie, feeling the ache in my limbs from staying awake all night, and trying to piece together the next steps.

I already knew check-in had closed. By now the plane should be boarding. So even if the ESTA came through instantly, it wouldn’t matter. Not for today.

*Okay,* I told myself. *Then figure out where to sleep. One thing at a time.*

So I opened my messages again — past the texts with Louise — and tapped into a chat with the only two people I knew in the city: Ellen and Sofia. My thumbs hovered for a moment before I managed to gather my scattered thoughts and constructed a more or less sensible message

      "time":"2025-11-07T09:04:04"
    }

</sms-chat>

*One can always ask*. It was a Friday and I knew Sofia was both working and attending another gig in the evening, that's why she wasn't able to stay out so late the night before. Ellen on the other hand might not be busy. 

Then I navigated back to the browser and refreshed the ESTA page, expecting — as usual — nothing. But this time something *did* change. A bold green banner flashed across the top:

**Your travel authorization has been approved.**

I froze. Blinked once. Leaned in and blinked again. *You’re kidding*. I glanced at Melvin as if he’d personally negotiated with U.S. immigration services on my behalf. Maybe this was his true purpose. *If only I had gone to the café an hour sooner, Melvin would've helped me make it to my flight.*

As I was thinking silly thoughts like this I saw my phone, still bright with the ESTA application page open, flash with another notification.

And she sent her address. 

Not only had the flights just figured themselves out, but the problem of not having anywhere to sleep had also been resolved within minutes. *I don't know what I did to deserve things working out so well,* I thought to myself while grasping the cup with both hands. The feeling of calmness was as instant as the coffee I was heating myself on. I put the cup down on the empty, green, plastic seat next to me – careful to balance it in the middle part of the curvature of the seat. This left my hands free to construct a reply, making sure I wasn't interrupting Ellen's day all too bad.

And so I set off towards the trains. *Gods I love unemployed people.*
