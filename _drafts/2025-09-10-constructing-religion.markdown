*Points I want to make here:*
- *Upon constructing a set of rules that i follow like a slave I noticed that over time the need for a rule might change. They become meaningless if my context changes or if I change as a person*
- *Eventually I started adding fun rules. Just to make it feel personal to me and my interests and hobbies. Personality creates meaning.*
- *One can be rational as a person and still follow "irrational" rules. -> perspective on science and religion harmonizing*
- *Why I did this: reducing decision fatigue. Making algorithms that are easy to follow and that somewhat guarantee the best possible outcome.*
- *not a theologist btw*

I follow a specific set of rules that I have carefully defined in a personal document. I know, I know, it sounds very robot-like when put that way, but in a sense I think we all have certain protocols that we live by, don't we? Humans, contrary to other forms of life, have an extraordinary ability of categorizing and analyzing even the abstract. So in a sense, rewriting my own source code was indeed very human of me. Not robot, thank you very much. 

It struck me recently that I started doing this back in 2015, meaning this experiment is now 10 years in the making.
