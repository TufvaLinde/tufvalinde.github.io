It was a spring evening earlier this year. I was at home, not up to much. 

You know those group chats that no one ever leaves, and also no one remembers joining? Mine was called *sauna club* and it was a chat with around 20 people out of which I only knew 2. I never showed up to sauna club. They were always on Monday evenings, when I had volleyball practise. I felt estranged from the club, being the only one who never showed, but I stayed in the chat anyways.

On this evening I happened to look at my phone and see the (muted) chat flickering with new messages. It wasn't Monday, but of course, they do write about other things than the sauna as well. Curious, I opened it: 

<sms-chat group-by-minutes="3"
  bubble-timestamps="true"
  show-group-time="false"
  show-day-separators="true"
  locale="auto"
  my-bubble-color="#00f">
  <script type="application/json">
  [
    {"who":"them", "name":"Movits","text":"come and carve","time":"2025-03-27T17:04:34"},
    {"who":"them","text":"+46XXXXXXXXX","time":"2025-03-27T17:05:23"}
  ]
  </script>
</sms-chat>

Movits was one of the people in the chat I had actually met, briefly. I like Movits. I was intrigued by his lack of context and called the provided number. He picked up. 

And that's the start of one of my newest hobbies.

<div class="step" markdown="1">

#### **STEP 1 - say yes to trying something new**
A new hobby does not have to begin with intention. I honestly think they rarely do. They begin in the spontaneous moments when you give yourself permission to explore something that sparks curiosity. And what does that take? Some time. Some energy. And maybe a guy named Movits saying, “come and carve.”

</div>

<p markdown="1">
    So I just showed up. It was a carving club[^1] located in a cellar wood working studio on one of those narrow, cobble-stoned, Södermalm streets. Going there felt like an adventure. The studio was full of people chopping away with <span data-note="axe">carving axes</span> and moraknivar in silence. No formal instruction. Just a calm crowd of strangers making spoons and butter knives. Movits was making a sauna ladle. I found a branch of birch (approximately 7 cm in width) on the floor and started carving away using the provided tools.

  developed by the owner of the studio, Julia Kalthoff. she is very nice and creates beautiful wooden bears (as well as awesome carving axes of course)

I didn't really know what I was doing. I chose to let the wood decide what it wanted to become as I was carving it. Very quickly it became… well, unmistakably phallic.<span class="thought"> oh no - actually I will decide then</span>. I steered it toward the direction of a hattifnatt (slender, ghostlike, electric creatures from the moomin world). It would be a nice addition to stand by my moomin cup collection at home.
</p>

I honestly didn't get very far on my hattifnatt that evening. Just the body and a rough shapeless blob that was supposed to be the first hand. 
</p>
<p markdown="1">
It was ugly.
</p>
<p markdown="1">
I loved it. 
 </p>
 <p markdown="1">
It **didn’t matter** what it looked like, and this was very important. No one was watching. No one cared if I was “good” at carving. I was honestly so green at this that I wasn’t even sure what good would mean. There was no critique, no comparison, no one scrutinizing my technique. Which brings me to:
</p>

<div class="step" markdown="1">

#### **STEP 2 - be terrible at it**
It's gonna happen anyways, so just lean into it. The first time you try something can’t be about prestige. You are an adult; no one is grading you. You don't even have to present your results. Learn to have fun while being bad. You’re allowed to make something terrible and keep it just because it made you laugh. Or you could  b u r n  i t . Whatever. That’s the point: no pressure. You’re just doing.[^2]

*Tragic* **magic**. That night I walked home with a sad wooden cucumber in my hand, and a big goofy smile on my face.

I continued carving throughout the rest of the spring and summer. I finished the hand of the hattinfatt. Made another hand. Attached them to the body. Painted it. **Finished.** 

My friend Wille told me he had no butter knife at home. Knives are easy. I found a good piece of wood in the forest that was already almost knife-shaped. I carved it down. *is it done?* Tested it. *it sucks*. Carved the curvature of the blade down a bit more. Now it smears butter nicely. **Finished** (and now Wille has a butter knife - yay!)

Then I stumbled upon a very rough wooden man while visiting Konstfack, in a container where students had dumped unfinished pieces from this years semester. I took it. Continued carving on it for about a month. The arms were looking wayyy off. I leaned into the alienness of it and let the arms stay long enough to reach the floor. It looked intentionally weird. **Finished.**

Inspired by my long-limbed creature, I wanted to make another sculpture. This time with two of the creatures hugging. Their long arms wrapping multiple laps around each other. I am still finishing the sanding of this piece.[^3]

Over the past half year I have thus finished two and a half sculptures and one butter knife. It's not much, *but it's also not little*. I don't know the types of wood I used for each of the projects. I probably don't use the best technique <span class="thought">(not even the safest technique >.> Man, have I cut myself many times)</span>, but that doesn't mean that I can't finish something. And when I showed up to my second carving club night this september, long-limbed-hugging-sculpture in hand, I was complimented for it by almost everyone there.

So, step three? 

<div class="step" markdown="1">

#### **STEP 3 - let the hobby stay what it wants to be**
There is no rush to turn it into a side hustle or a lifestyle or a pinterest board. Just keep doing it in the way that maximizes your joy - that is always a good metric for success. Let the hobby stay weird if it makes you happy :)
</div>

Of course, getting credited at the studio was fun, but what is even more fun is when I realized that I'd actually stuck to this over the whole summer. The amount of hours I had spent seated in the grass were all well spent. Not because I was producing good carvings, but because I still found joy in the process. I still delight in the idea of one of these october days being warm enough to go outside and finish this last piece of the season. I still lose track of time when I carve. 

And that's how I know this new hobby is now mine.
