my new therapist said as she looked up from the booking system on her laptop.

**“Bra!”** I replied. Then I hesitated.

**“Förresten, vad ska vi ens prata om de här tre gångerna? Du är ju experten, så efter att du nu fått en inblick i mig, vad tror du känns värt att fokusera på?”**

I think this aligns better with the things I actually want to discuss in therapy).

And when digging into the etymology, I learned that in philosophical value theory it’s also (somewhat loosely) used to describe the idea of something having value regardless of an observer’s opinion - or the absence of a metric to measure it.
