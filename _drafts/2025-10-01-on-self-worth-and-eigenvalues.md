**“Okej, då har vi en plan.”** (*“Okay, then we have a plan.”*)

my new therapist said as she looked up from the booking system on her laptop.

**“Bra!”** I replied. Then I hesitated.

**“Förresten, vad ska vi ens prata om de här tre gångerna? Du är ju experten, så efter att du nu fått en inblick i mig, vad tror du känns värt att fokusera på?”** (*“Actually, what are we even going to talk about during these three sessions? You’re the expert, and since you’ve now gotten some insight into me, what do you think is worth focusing on?”*)

She paused for a moment, looking up at the ceiling, then looked at me and said:

**“Vad tror du om att vi fortsätter där vi avslutade idag; det här med egenvärden?”** (*“What do you think about continuing with where we left off today; this idea of self-worth?”*)

I smiled as she said this. Not because I was thrilled at the thought of dissecting my sense of self-worth in therapy for the next three weeks, but because the Swedish word **egenvärde** has a double meaning. In everyday speech, it’s used the same way we use the word *self-worth* in English. But in mathematics, it means *eigenvalue*. 

I don’t know if my therapist knows this. Likely, the words she chooses have a well-defined meanings in psychology. I know little about psychology. I assume she knows little about mathematics. And at this point in time <span data-note="math">I have not even told my therapist that I do mathematics.</span> (The picture I painted for her was that I am a tortured artist. I think this aligns better with the things I actually want to discuss in therapy).

When digging into the etymology, I learned that in philosophical value theory the word is also (somewhat loosely) used to describe the idea of something having value regardless of an observer’s opinion - or the absence of a metric to measure it    ...
