title: is it wrong to put your phone away?

It is not rare that my text conversations look something like this:

<sms-chat group-by-minutes="3"
  bubble-timestamps="true"
  show-group-time="false"
  show-day-separators="true"
  locale="auto"
  my-bubble-color="#00f">
  <script type="application/json">
  [
    {"who":"them", "name":"Anna","text":"hi tuf! just wanted to ask if you'd be down to play some beach later?","time":"2025-09-01T09:12:34"},
    {"who":"me","text":"hey! what time are we talking? i'll be in the office until 13 at least","time":"2025-09-04T11:10:23"},
    {"who":"them","text":"this was relevant 4 days ago...","time":"2025-09-04T11:14:47"}
  ]
  </script>
</sms-chat>

Here’s a sentence with an <span class="annotated" id="note-hex">odd little aside</span> I’d like to comment on.
<aside class="margin-note" data-for="note-hex">
  This is the margin comment that sits beside the highlighted text.
  You can put **markdown** inside if you want; Jekyll will render it.
</aside>
