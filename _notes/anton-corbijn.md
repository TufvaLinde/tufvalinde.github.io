> "What people call your style is simply your inability to do it any other way." 

\- Anton Corbijn seen on a TV installation at his Fotografiska exhibition in September 2025, cited here from memory to the best of my ability. 

I kept this quote because the perspective of style as something inherent and unchangeable about oneself made me calm.
