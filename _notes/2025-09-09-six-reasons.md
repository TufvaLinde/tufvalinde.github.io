title: 6 reasons why 6 is my favourite number
---

1. it is the smallest (mathematically) perfect number (meaning it is equal to the sum of its proper divisors)
2. it is also equal to the product of its proper divisors
3. there are 6 players on a volleyball court
4. a 6 sided regular polygon is capable of tiling the plane AND when it does, each interior angle is 120° which means that if you extend a ray along its external bisector, it aligns exactly with the line of contact where two neighboring hexagons meet in the tessellation. *i am aware that this is very specific, but as someone with the idiosyncrasy of avoiding extended rays from angles smaller than 180° i find it deeply satisfying to walk on hexagonal grids. i have noted that all the german petrol stations i’ve visited (admittedly only a few) had hexagonal tiles on the ground. this is why i like german petrol stations.*
5. my birthday is on the 6th
6. hexagons are pretty
